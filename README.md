# BioTap by Pistachio

## Overview
This project creates an application for testing biometric security in Android
phones. It was part of a group project by CCSU students taking course CS410, 
Systems Engineering, during the fall of 2015.

## Functionality
The application is built and deployed as an Android application. A user has 
the ability to enter in a passcode by tapping the devices screen a minimum of 
3 times, and repeating the tap sequence 3 times for the device to get an 
average score the the sequence. Then users have the ability to attempt to 
reenter the tap sequence, with a score deciding how close the user was to the
original sequence.
